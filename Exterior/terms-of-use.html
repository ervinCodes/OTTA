        OTTA has taken on the challenge of disrupting the traditional hiring process in Production Accounting, which we believe is long overdue for change.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl">
        The digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic has had a major impact on our industry, and it's clear that the old ways of doing things are no longer sustainable.  Many Production Accounting departments have had to double in size just to keep up with the increased workload.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl">
        Our primary goal is to streamline the hiring process in Production Accounting, which we believe will benefit everyone involved: department heads, studios, production companies, and the talented production accounting professionals who are seeking opportunities.  OTTA provides a central hub for talent and a more efficient way to match job openings with the right candidates.  We aim to reduce the stress and frustration that has long been a part of this process.
