All decisions pertaining to hiring, including but not limited to employment opportunities submitted through OTTA or any other means, fall under the sole responsibility of the hiring entity. OTTA explicitly
              disclaims any involvement in or responsibility for employment, hiring, or salary determinations made by you or any other individual, even if OTTA were utilized for job submission or communication relating to employment, hiring, or salary decisions. Furthermore, OTTA does not accept any responsibility or liability for the behavior or conduct of any employee hired by an employer, both at present and in perpetuity.</p>

              <p class="font-bold text-2xl">VIII. Star Reviews for Registered Users (“Members”) on OTTA-Related Shows</p>
              <br>
              <p>OTTA Star Reviews are designed to recognize and commend OTTA Team Members (“User”) at the end of each OTTA-related show. In addition, Star Reviews can expedite hiring decisions while creating measurable data making it easier to connect performance to compensation. OTTA is not responsible nor liable for Star Review Ratings. Ratings are made by the Supervisor, based on their professional opinion and experience and at their sole discretion.</p>
              <br>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-8">
                <li>Employers receive OTTA Resumes and Star Reviews for OTTA-related shows via automated emails containing links to Member resumes and limited access to OTTA Star Reviews.</li>
                <li>There are defined standard Star Reviews for each role.</li>
                <li>Registered Users have access to Star Reviews for every role in advance of each show on the website. It is highly recommended that the User reviews the Star Review criteria to better understand the expectations of the job.</li>
                <li>Members either receive a star for their effort or not. There is a space for Member responses to stars they did not receive.</li>

                <li>You agree Star Reviews will be based on first-hand experiences. You agree that acceptance of any form of compensation in return for Star Reviews subjects you to immediate termination of your membership in OTTA.</li>

                <li>Participation in the Star Review process does not reflect the views of OTTA, its officers, managers, owners, employees, consultants, agents, designees, successors or their respective directors, officers, and employees, or other users nor can they be held liable in any way for the results.</li>

              <p>If you identify a discrepancy on your payment card statement, you agree to notify us within 90 days of the identified discrepancy appearing on your credit card statement. Otherwise, such discrepancy will
              be deemed waived. If we do not receive payment from your payment card issuer or its agent, you agree to our demand to pay all amounts due. We will not be responsible for any unauthorized amounts billed to your payment card by a third party.</p>
